This repository is used to store all my notes and other helpful documents I use for my various studies.
Each folder contains the files for a specific topic. See the list below for more information (folders marked with (WIP) are still a work in process but feel free to read through what notes are available.

1. c-compendium: Notes on the C programming language. (WIP)
2. textbooks: Has textbooks and other resources I have used to study or found useful.
3. tex-template.tex: The template I use for all my tex files.
4. c++compendium: Notes on the C++ programming language. (WIP)
5. python-compendium: Notes on the Python programming language. (WIP)
6. git&github-compendium: Notes on useing Git and GitHub to manage projects.
Disclaimer: I recently moved from using emacs org-mode for my latex documents to Vimtex so not all the notes have tex documents as yet. If you would like the unformatted tex files just let me know through a pm or email (work.anrichjtait@gmail.com)
