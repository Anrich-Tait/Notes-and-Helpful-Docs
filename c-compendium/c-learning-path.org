* Concepts for Coding a Quiz Program in C

To code a program like a quiz program in C, you will need to understand the following concepts:

1. Basic syntax and control structures of the programming language (in this
   case, C). This includes variables, data types, operators, loops, conditional
   statements, and functions.
   

2. Arrays: how to declare, initialize, and access elements of an array.

3. Strings: how to declare, initialize, and manipulate strings. In C, strings
   are represented as arrays of characters.

4. Functions: how to define and use functions to organize your code and make it reusable.

5. Input/output: how to read input from the user and display output to the
   console. In C, this is typically done using the `scanf()` and `printf()`
   functions.
   
6. Conditionals: how to use if-else statements and switch statements to control
   the flow of your program based on certain conditions.
   
7. Loops: how to use for loops and while loops to repeat blocks of code.

8. Logical operators and comparisons: how to use logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   and comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) to evaluate conditions in
   your code.
   
9. Arrays of arrays: how to create and use multidimensional arrays, which are
   arrays of arrays.
   
By learning these concepts in this order, you will build a strong foundation in
the basics of programming and gradually build up to more advanced topics like
arrays of arrays.
