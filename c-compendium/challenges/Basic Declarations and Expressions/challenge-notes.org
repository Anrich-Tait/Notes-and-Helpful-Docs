* Challenge 2:
Write a C program to get the C version you are using.

** argc and argv:
In C, argc and argv are used to pass command-line arguments to a C program.

argc stands for "argument count" and is an integer that specifies the number of
arguments passed to the program when it is run. It is automatically set by the C
runtime system and is typically at least 1, since the first argument is the name
of the program itself.


argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings that contains the
actual arguments passed to the program. The first element of argv (i.e.,
argv[0]) is always the name of the program itself, while the remaining elements
contain the command-line arguments.
